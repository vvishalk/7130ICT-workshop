    "The two most common forms of recommendation systems are acknowledged to be content-based and collaborative filtering recommender systems. Making recommendations to users based on the actions of a group of users as a whole is known as collaborative filtering. The advice is based on other people's tastes. A clear example would be recommending a movie to a user since their friend enjoyed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Content-Based: This method of filtering depends on the data that is accessible about the items. Products that are similar to those that a user has already indicated they favour are suggested by the algorithm. The similarity, which is commonly determined by calculating cosine similarity, is computed using the user's past preferences and the available information about the goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Collaborative-Based: The method of filtering known as collaborative filtering is based on aggregating user actions and contrasting them with other users' actions stored in the database. The recommendations that are sent to users are mostly determined by their past behaviour, with each user's activities having a significant impact on this algorithm. The main distinction between collaborative filtering and content-based filtering is that in the latter, user interactions with the items have an impact on the algorithm that generates suggestions. On the other hand, content-based filtering only considers the information unique to that one individual."
